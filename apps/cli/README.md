# Dokugen 📝

Dokugen is a sophisticated CLI utility designed to automate the generation of high-quality, professional README documentation. Built with TypeScript and Node.js, it streamlines the documentation process by providing an interactive, user-friendly interface to capture project details and output standardized Markdown files that impress stakeholders and contributors alike.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine:

*   **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:samueltuoyo15/Dokugen.git
    cd Dokugen
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies**
    This project uses `pnpm` for efficient package management.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

*   **Build the Project**
    Compile the TypeScript source code into executable JavaScript.
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```

## Usage

Once the project is built, you can run the tool directly from the terminal. The build process automatically handles file permissions for the binary on Unix-based systems.

To start the interactive generator, run:
```bash
./dist/bin/dokugen.mjs
```

Alternatively, if you have linked the package locally:
```bash
dokugen
```

The tool will guide you through a series of prompts to gather information about your project's name, description, installation steps, and features to build your README.md file dynamically.

## Features

*   **Interactive Prompts**: Utilizes a modern CLI interface to gather project metadata seamlessly.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Includes specialized scripts to handle file permissions on Linux/macOS while remaining compatible with Windows.
*   **Type-Safe Architecture**: Developed entirely in TypeScript to ensure codebase reliability and maintainability.
*   **Automated Build Pipeline**: Features a robust post-install and post-build workflow to prepare the distribution files automatically.
*   **Zero-Config Output**: Generates clean, standardized Markdown that follows industry best practices.
