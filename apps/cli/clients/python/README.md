## Standalone Binaries (Experimental)

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental Vibes:** These standalone binaries are super new and honestly pretty unstable. If you use them, you’ll probably run into issues, that’s just how it is right now. If it breaks, just stick to the Node.js and Python version for now.

You can also try our standalone binaries if you don't want to install Python or Node.js.
