# Dokugen: Your README.md Generator ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Current Version: 3.0.0 ü§ó

A CLI tool to automatically generate high-quality README files for your projects. Spend less time on documentation and more time building!

## Description

Dokugen scans your project, analyzes the file structure and codebase, and then generates a comprehensive `README.md` file based on your project type and key characteristics. It supports various languages and frameworks, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, and more. It also asks you key questions like "Does your project use Docker?" to improve the output.

## Installation

To install Dokugen globally and make it accessible from any project directory, run:

```bash
npm install -g dokugen
```

### Verify Installation

Ensure Dokugen is installed by checking its version:

```bash
dokugen --version
```

## Usage

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
npx dokugen generate
```

The tool will guide you through a few questions to customize the README generation process. If a `README.md` already exists, you will be prompted to overwrite it.

### Example

```bash
cd my-awesome-project
npx dokugen generate
```

The tool will then generate a `README.md` file in your project's root directory.
